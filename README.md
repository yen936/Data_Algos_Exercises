# Data_Algos_Exercises
Some code I wrote to complete exercises from my Data Structures and Algorithms course.  


## cartesian.py

Given a point P (p) on a cartesian plane, take a given amount of steps along the x-axis and y-axis for each iteration and get as close to p as possible. 
After every 3rd iteration, take a given amount of steps backwards in the x and y directions.
Arrive at a point (x, y) whose distance is closest to p (using the distance formula). Start at the origin (0,0).
